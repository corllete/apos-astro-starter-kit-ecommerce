# apostrophecms/astro-frontend

This is an Astro-based website, with editable content powered by ApostropheCMS.

To complete your project, you will need to fork *two* repositories:
this one (the starting point for your Astro project), and the
[`apostrophecms/starter-kit-astro`](https://github.com/apostrophecms/starter-kit-astro)
project to power content editing, store your content, handle media uploads and
provide a complete and user-friendly on-page editing experience. This kind of
side-by-side development separating the "front end" or "front for back" (Astro)
from the content management system (ApostropheCMS) is common when working with
Astro.

Please see the [`@apostrophecms/apostrophe-astro`](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-astro) documentation
for complete information about how to get started with this project.
